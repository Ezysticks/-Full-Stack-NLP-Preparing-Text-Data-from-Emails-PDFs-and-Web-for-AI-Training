# ðŸš€ Full-Stack NLP: Preparing Text Data from Emails, PDFs, and Web for AI Training
 This project implements a complete text data pipeline for LLM fine-tuning. It automates the extraction, cleaning, and formatting of text data from multiple sourcesâ€”emails (IMAP), PDFs (pdfplumber), and web scraping (BeautifulSoup). The processed data is converted into JSONL format for seamless integration with Hugging Face Transformers. Additionally, it includes data manipulation with Pandas and fine-tuning an LLM model for custom AI applications.

âœ… Extract & clean text from Emails, PDFs, and Web
âœ… Convert text to JSONL format for fine-tuning
âœ… Load and analyze processed data with Pandas
âœ… Fine-tune and test a custom LLM model

ðŸ“Œ **Tech Stack:** Python, NLP, Transformers, IMAP, pdfplumber, BeautifulSoup, Pandas
